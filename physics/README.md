# Physics ðŸš€

This class is an algebra-based physics course taken in freshman year taught by Schafer.

The class is definitely a lot easier if you come into it with a strong math background.

## Topic Breakdown

More in-depth material in each folder.
In each folder there will be a ***README.pdf*** which will contain all the notes you need.

### Unit 1: 1-D Motion

The foundation of everything. This unit is definitely way easier if you have a strong math background.
All the definitions will be defined here too like vectors, etc.

### Unit 2: 2-D Motion

This unit is basically just an extension of the first unit.
It doesn't get much harder as the horizontal and vertical are independent.

### Unit 3: Forces and Gravitation

The hardest unit in my opinion but it isn't that bad if you draw all the force diagrams.
The important thing here is to ***draw all the Force Diagrams***.

### Unit 4: Circular Motion and Energy

The most fun unit in my opinion. This unit is also tricky.
Conversation of Energy is your best friend.

### Unit 5: Momentum Waves & Oscillation

This unit is not that hard, mostly just applying the formulas.
Notably: *This unit and the next/last don't have quizzes/tests*

### Unit 6: Rotational Motion and Electricity & Magnetism

Rotational Motion stuff is useful for the Trebuchet project.
The E&M section has one homework set and that's it.
You learn about circuitry and there's a cool game to go with it.
